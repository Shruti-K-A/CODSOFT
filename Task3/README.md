## ATM Machine – Java Console Application

This project is a simple, beginner-friendly ATM Machine simulation created using Java.
It follows clean Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and works entirely through a console menu — just like a mini real-world ATM.

The goal of this project is to understand how different classes interact with each other and how everyday banking operations can be coded in an easy, readable manner.

## What This ATM Can Do

This ATM program lets the user:

* Check their account balance

* Deposit money

* Withdraw money (only if enough balance is available!)

* Exit safely with a goodbye message

Everything works through a simple number-based menu so even someone new to Java can use it easily.

## Project Structure 

This project uses 3 classes:

 1. ATM Class

The main controller of the program.
It shows the menu, takes user input, and calls the bank operations.

 2. BankAccount Class

Stores the balance and contains the actual deposit and withdrawal logic.

 3. ATMApplication (Main Class)

Creates the ATM object and starts the whole system.

This structure keeps the code clean, modular, and easy to understand.

## How the Program Works 

When the program starts, an ATM object is created with a starting balance (₹4000).

The menu appears with options:
Check Balance / Deposit / Withdraw / Exit.

User selects an option.

Based on the choice, ATM calls the corresponding method in the BankAccount class.

Program keeps running until the user chooses to exit.

## How to Run the Program

Make sure Java (JDK) is installed.

Save the file as ATMApplication.java

Open your terminal (or command prompt).

## Compile the program:

javac ATMApplication.java

## Run it:

java ATMApplication


Enjoy your mini ATM!
